          <strong>There are various types of ducks in the world. </strong>In programming, the
          rubber duck is very popular. Rubber ducking is the act of debugging
          code out loud by explaining the code to a rubber duck, line by line.
          <br />
          <br />
          This method often allows a programmer to hit upon the solution to the
          bug. One for my desk at home would be useful for the many times I get
          confused by my own code. This duck is the one that sits on my desk at
          work. It doesn't know anything about fighting the IRS, but it still
          looks cute.

            The tradition of squeaking them throughout the day, and the local park with lake, greenery and wildlife brought respite throughout the days
