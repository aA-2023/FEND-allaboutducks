        <p>
          Have you ever been overwhelmed by life? By school? By the IRS forcing
          you back into the workforce past age 70??
        </p>
        <p class="it">
          By code that doesn't do what you want it to do, even though you're
          sure it should?
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope this blog will bring you peace. Every day I will feature a new
          duck to make you smile and make you forget about your troubles for a
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, I also recommend visiting your local duck pond, so you can
          hear them quack and watch them swim. Just make sure not to feed them
          any bread. That's actually quite bad for them.

The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document.

The content inside the <main> element should be unique to the
  document. It should not contain any content that is repeated
  across documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright
  information, site logos, and search forms.

Note: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document.
   The <main> element must NOT be a descendant of an <article>,
    <aside>, <footer>, <header>, or <nav> element.
